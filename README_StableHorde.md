Information specific to the Stable Diffusion image generation.

# Generating Prompts

## GUI

We provide [a client interface](https://dbzer0.itch.io/lucid-creations) requiring no installation and no technical expertise.

You can also see our wiki which [describes multiple available frontends made by the Haidra community](https://github.com/Haidra-Org/AI-Horde/wiki/Available-client-interfaces).


## Command Line

I have provided [a small python script](https://github.com/Haidra-Org/AI-Horde-CLI) with which you can use to call the horde. Please check the [README](https://github.com/Haidra-Org/AI-Horde-CLI/blob/main/README.md) for usage instructions.

# Joining the horde

Anyone can convert their own PC into a worker which generates or interrogates images for other people in the horde and gains kudos for doing so. To do so, they need to run a software we call the AI Horde Worker, which bridges your Stable Diffusion inference to the AI Horde via REST API.

We have prepared a [very simple installation procedure for running the bridge on each OS](https://github.com/Haidra-Org/horde-worker-reGen#readme).
