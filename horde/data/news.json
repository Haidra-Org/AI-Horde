He used what we know best and we trained an explicit model to calculate kudos, based on the performance of his own GPU on the comfy branch This new calculation should be much more accurate in terms of things like controlnet and resolution impact. The good news is that the new comfy branch this seems to reduce kudos costs for high resolutions accross the board. Note: Due to the current worker (based on nataili) being slightly lower quality at the benefit of speed, and thus getting a boost due to the new kudos model, we have implemented a 25% reduction for its rewards to bring it up to line with its actual performance.",
