<img style="float:right" src="{horde_img_url}" width="300" /> This is a [crowdsourced distributed cluster](https://github.com/Haidra-Org/AI-Horde) of [Image generation workers](https://github.com/Haidra-Org/horde-worker-reGen) and [text generation workers](https://github.com/Haidra-Org/AI-Horde-Worker). If you like this service, consider [joining the horde yourself](https://github.com/Haidra-Org/AI-Horde/blob/main/README_StableHorde.md#joining-the-horde)!

### Real-time stats
* You can see the horde activity (also past stats) on [Grafana](https://grafana.aihorde.net/)

## Usage

First [Register an account](/register) which will generate for you an API key. Store that key somewhere.

   * if you do not want to register, you can use '0000000000' as api_key to connect anonymously. However anonymous accounts have the lowest priority when there's too many concurrent requests!
   * To increase your priority you will need a unique API key and then to increase your Kudos. [Read how Kudos are working](https://dbzer0.com/blog/the-kudos-based-economy-for-the-koboldai-horde/).

## REST API

[Full Documentation](/api)

If you are developing a paid or ad-based integration with the Stable Horde, we request that you use part of your profits to support the horde. If your app is solely reliant on the volunteer resources of the horde, we expect at least 50% of those should go to supporting the horde itself, preferrably by onboarding your own workers. If the horde is merely an option among many, we suggest you assign some workers to the horde depending on how much it's being utilized by your client base.
