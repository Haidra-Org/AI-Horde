# Stable Horde

<img style="float:right" src="{horde_img_url}/{horde_image}.jpg" width="300" /> This is a [crowdsourced distributed cluster](https://github.com/db0/Stable-Horde) of [Stable Diffusion workers](https://github.com/db0/stable-diffusion-webui). If you like this service, consider joining the horde yourself!

## Stats 

* Average Recent Performance: {avg_performance} {avg_thing_name} per second
* Total GPS generated: {total_things} {total_things_name}
* Total requests fulfilled: {total_fulfillments}
* Active [Workers](/api/v2/workers): {active_workers}
* Queue: {total_queue} requests for a total of {queued_things} {queued_things_name}

## Usage

First [Register an account](/register) which will generate for you an API key. Store that key somewhere.

   * if you do not want to register, you can use '0000000000' as api_key to connect anonymously. However anonymous accounts have the lowest priority when there's too many concurrent requests!
   * To increase your priority you will need a unique API key and then to increase your Kudos. [Read how Kudos are working](https://dbzer0.com/blog/the-kudos-based-economy-for-the-koboldai-horde/).

### GUI

We provide [a client interface](https://dbzer0.itch.io/stable-horde-client) requiring no installation and no technical expertise

### Command Line
1. Git clone [this repository](https://github.com/db0/Stable-Horde)
1. Make sure you have python3 installed
1. Open a git bash (or just bash in linux)
1. Download the cli requirements with `python -m pip install -r cli_requirements.txt --user`
1. Run `./cli_requests.py` 

You can use `./cli_requests.py -h` to see the command line arguments to use

You can make a copy of `cliRequestData_template.py` into `cliRequestData.py` and edit it, to use common variables for your generations. Command line arguments will always take precedence over `cliRequestData.py` so you can use them to tweak your generations slightly.

### Tools

We provide a [Godot Engine plugin](https://github.com/db0/Stable-Horde-Client-Addon) to integrate Stable Horde image generation into your games.
