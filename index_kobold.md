# KoboldAI Horde

<img style="float:right" src="{horde_img_url}/{horde_image}.jpg" width="300" /> This is a [crowdsourced distributed cluster](https://github.com/db0/AI-Horde) of [KoboldAI clients](https://github.com/KoboldAI/KoboldAI-Client). You can download the client and use it to experience stories similar to AI-Dungeon for free. If you like this service, consider joining the horde yourself! 

For more information, check [the FAQ](https://github.com/db0/AI-Horde/blob/main/FAQ.md). Also check out our sister project for image generation: [Stable Horde](https://stablehorde.net). Finally you can also follow the [main developer's blog](https://dbzer0.com)

## Usage

First [Register an account](/register) which will generate for you an API key. Store that key somewhere.

   * if you do not want to register, you can use '0000000000' as api_key to connect anonymously. However anonymous accounts have the lowest priority when there's too many concurrent requests!
   * To increase your priority you will need a unique API key and then to increase your Kudos. [Read how Kudos are working](https://dbzer0.com/blog/the-kudos-based-economy-for-the-koboldai-horde/).
